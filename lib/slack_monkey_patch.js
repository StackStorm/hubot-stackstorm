  // requests are merged.
  // This code was refactored in https://github.com/StackStorm/hubot-stackstorm/pull/6
  // which was opened and merged by Kami on 2015-06-04.
  // As of 2019-05-22, these were the PRs I could find for the node-slack-client
  // hubot-slack repositories:
  // * https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/pull/42
  //   - which was closed during a refactor and converted into an issue:
  //     https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/138
  // * https://github.com/slackapi/hubot-slack/pull/544
  //   - which was opened on 2018-11-14, which seems to be too late to actually
  //     apply to this code
  // So...I'm not entirely sure this monkey patch is still necessary.
  // End-to-end testing is required to figure out for sure.
