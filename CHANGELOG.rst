Changelog
=========

in development
--------------
* Update ``lodash`` and ``st2client`` dependencies (improvement)

0.12.0
------

* Clean slack-injected latin1 nbsp character (/xA0) from command to improve command recognition.
  Slack will sometimes replace a space with /xA0, often near something that renders as a link.
  Now, when someone copies that command, they can paste it and still have hubot recognize it.
